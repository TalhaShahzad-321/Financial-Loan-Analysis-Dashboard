🚀 Financial Loan Analysis Dashboard Project

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, a comprehensive and dynamic Financial Loan Analysis Dashboard. This project showcases my expertise in both SQL and Power BI, where I seamlessly integrated SQL queries with DAX measures to create insightful visualizations that help in making data-driven decisions.

📝 Project Overview:
The project involved analyzing a financial loan dataset to derive key metrics and insights. The analysis was conducted using a combination of SQL queries to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, followed by the creation of interactive Power BI visualizations to display the results.

📊 Key Metrics:
Total Loan Applications: Count of all loan applications received.
Total Funded Amount: Sum of loan amounts that were successfully funded.
Total Amount Received: Total amount received from loan payments.
Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: The average DTI ratio, calculated for both current and previous months.
Good Loan Percentage: The percentage of loans classified as 'Good' (Fully Paid or Current).
Bad Loan Percentage: The percentage of loans classified as 'Bad' (Charged Off).
Month-over-Month (MOM) Change: The MOM percentage change in key metrics like loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts.
📈 Visualizations:
📊 Stacked Column Chart: Comparison of Current vs. Previous Month DTI Ratio, showing how the debt-to-income ratio has changed over time.
📉 Line Chart: MOM Change in Total Loan Applications, illustrating trends in loan activity month-over-month.
🍩 Donut Chart: Good vs. Bad Loan Distribution, providing a visual breakdown of loan quality.
📊 Bar Chart: Total Funded Amount by State, highlighting which states have received the most loan funding.
📋 Matrix: Loan Status Overview, summarizing key metrics (Total Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount) by loan status.
📊 Stacked Bar Chart: Loan Performance by Purpose, showcasing how different loan purposes perform in terms of funding and repayment.
💡 Insights:
Debt-to-Income Trends:
The stacked column chart reveals significant month-over-month changes in the DTI ratio, helping to assess borrower risk.
Good vs. Bad Loan Analysis:
The donut chart highlights the proportion of loans that are performing well versus those that are not, aiding in risk assessment.
State-wise Loan Performance:
The bar chart provides insights into which states have the highest funded amounts, useful for regional strategy planning.
🛠️ Lessons Learned:
Validating Data Across Platforms: By comparing SQL query outputs with Power BI visualizations, I ensured data accuracy and consistency.
Leveraging DAX for Advanced Calculations: DAX was used to calculate Month-to-Date (MTD), Previous Month-to-Date (PMTD), and MOM metrics, providing deeper insights.
Creating User-Friendly Dashboards: The use of slicers and filters made the dashboard interactive and accessible for users, enhancing the decision-making process.
